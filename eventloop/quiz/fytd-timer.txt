- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
we run the code first, it will show:
foo
baz
foo
baz
2 : bar
1 : bar

the order of execution and the corresponding console output will be:

"foo" (from foo(2))
"baz" (from foo(2))
"foo" (from foo(1))
"baz" (from foo(1))
"2 : bar" (from the delayed execution of bar(2))
"1 : bar" (from the delayed execution of bar(1))
